# Collision

Vector operations and collision detection.

## Not ready for use
**TODO:**

+ Add 3d vectors
+ Collision detection algorithms
  + Separating axis


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `collision` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:collision, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `collision` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:collision]]
    end
    ```
